## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
 
if you fell here it must be because you were interested in my profile or maybe something else, I don't know.
  
## Public information

My name is Felipe Soares. I currently live in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil and I am currently unemployed looking for a job. 

In my spare time, I try to study things that I have little knowledge of or when I feel curious about some topic, for example music and other things related to art, I have been doing this since I was 15 years old, and it helps me a lot to organize and seek inspirations and ideas for some of my future projects.

## Curiosities about me

* I started to become interested in programming in 2010, because of a game I had on Facebook called Social Empires. I started using the famous Cheat Engine and finding bugs in the items, and then I started writing some scripts in LUA without even having any idea that this was programming at the time. 

* I hate olives.
* I like to help people :)
